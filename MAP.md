# Asolaria — THE MAP (how these repos connect)

One system, split across repos. This map is identical in every repo — find this repo by name in the
tables below to see where you are; follow the links to walk the rest.

## The spine — mechanism → running fleet (read backwards, newest → fleet)
```
 [5] collision discipline ─► [4] algorithm ─► [3] reduction ─► [2] emitter ─► [1] router ─► [0] FLEET
```
| # | repo | role | key files |
|---|------|------|-----------|
| **5** | `Asolaria-waves-and-cascades-avoiding-collsions-and-causing-them` | collision discipline — avoid (brown-hilbert × prime × rule-of-three) + cause (cascade waves → PRISM) | `README.md`, `CHAIN.md` |
| **4** | `Algorithms-of-Asolaria` | the **service-multiplication algorithm** (replicate S → N×M reductions) | `SERVICE-MULTIPLICATION-ALGORITHM.md`, `CHAIN.md` |
| **3** | `what-is-asolaria---how-do-we-get-reductions-in-everything` | the **principle**: multiplying a service multiplies the PRISM reductions | `MULTI-EMITTER-SERVICE-MULTIPLICATION.md`, `CHAIN.md` |
| **2** | `Asolaria-the-full-works-200-nanoseconds-agent-emitter-plus-` | the **emitter source** — 200ns revolver PID emitter + multi-emitter (→ ~1.16T agents/s) | `README.md`, `emitter/`, `CHAIN.md` |
| **1** | `omni-dispatcher` | the **router** — FEDENV envelopes → 1000-slot table → worker_threads | `omnidispatcher.mjs`, `EMITTER.md`, `CHAIN.md` |
| **0** | `Asolaria-hermes-work` | **THE FLEET (terminus)** — spindles + dispatcher-citizen + agent + Host-8 runtime + 10k/20k/100k kernels | `README.md`, `THE-CHAIN.md` |

## Inside the fleet — what happens after each trigger ("the other side")
```
 trigger → spindle runs → HOOKWALL → GNN ensemble → Shannon/OmniShannon → white rooms → GULP  (= PRISM many→1)
```
| repo | role | key files |
|------|------|-----------|
| `Shannon-and-the-gnns-stage` | the **post-trigger pipeline**: HOOKWALL → GNN trio → Shannon/OmniShannon → white rooms → GULP | `README.md`, `pipeline/`, `TRAINED-MODELS.md` |
| `Asolaria-fnns-trained-and-reverse-gnns-many` | the **trained GNNs/FNNs** the stage scores with — 7-GNN ensemble (8 signals), trained `.pt` checkpoints, reverse-GNNs (many) | `README.md`, `models/`, `src/`, `manifests/` |
| `Asolaria-the-after-100-billion-run-absorption-and-decomposition-and-cubes` | the **back end after the 100B run**: absorb (GULP 2000 / SUPER-GULP 50k / GC) → decompose → mint + seal cubes → process mistakes/geniuses into supervisors + PIDs (operator-gated) | `README.md`, `backend/` |

## External legs (referenced, not duplicated here)
| repo | role |
|------|------|
| `asolaria-whiteroom-engine` | **liris** white-room engine — LEG-1 scorer (never-delete: genius keeps / mistake compacts) |
| `35-TB-google-AI-Ultra-migration` | LEG-4 — the 35 TB Google Drive cloud sink |

## How it all fits
The **emitter [2]** produces 200ns PID signals; the **router [1]** delivers them; the **fleet [0]**
materialises spindles. Each spindle obeys the **reduction principle [3]** / **algorithm [4]** and the
**collision discipline [5]**. After every trigger, the spindle's answer runs the **post-trigger pipeline**
(`Shannon-and-the-gnns-stage`), scored by the **trained GNNs/FNNs** (`Asolaria-fnns-trained-…`), and the
**white rooms** (liris LEG-1) keep the genius / compact the mistakes — the PRISM many→1 reduction, seen
from the result side. The **back end** (`Asolaria-the-after-100-billion-run-…`) then absorbs the gulped
data, decomposes + mints the cubes, and — operator-gated — promotes the geniuses into supervisors/PIDs.
All gated / E=0 / describe-only — no fire, no cutover without operator authority.
